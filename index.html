    <h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hey, I’m Alvis Gordon—a tech geek, gamer, and proud dad. I’ve always been curious about how things work, which led me to building PCs, coding, and diving deep into gaming technology. I love tinkering with hardware, optimizing systems, and keeping up with the latest in tech, especially when it comes to Apple and gaming gear.

    Gaming is a huge part of my life. You’ll usually find me playing Civilization VI, GTA, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, or Cities: Skylines—whether I’m conquering the world, causing chaos, strategizing in battle, or building the perfect city. I love games that let me think, create, and push my limits.
    
    Outside of tech and gaming, being a dad is the most important part of my life. My son means everything to me, and watching him grow has been the most rewarding adventure of all.
    
    I’m also autistic (high-functioning) and have CPTSD, ODD, ADD, and ADHD. It shapes how I see the world and how I approach challenges. Some days are harder than others, but I see it as part of what makes me unique, determined, and creative.
    
    Right now, I’m studying ICT (Cert IV) and working toward my Master’s in IT. My goal is to turn my love for technology into a career in IT, cybersecurity, or system development. I’m always learning, always improving, and always looking for new ways to grow.
    
    When I’m not gaming or buried in tech, I enjoy writing, learning new skills, and geeking out over the latest advancements. I believe in curiosity, resilience, and always pushing forward, no matter what life throws at me.
    
    If you’re into tech, gaming, or just good conversations, hit me up—I’m always down to connect!
